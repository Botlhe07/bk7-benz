        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Mercedes-Benz is a German automotive brand known for luxury vehicles, buses, coaches, and trucks. The brand's origins date back to the late 19th century, with the creation of the first petrol-powered car by Karl Benz in 1886.</p>
        
        <p>In 1890, Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft (DMG) was founded by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach. The two companies, Benz & Cie and DMG, were fierce competitors in the early automotive industry.</p>
        
        <p>In 1926, the two companies merged to form the brand we know today as Mercedes-Benz. The name "Mercedes" comes from one of DMG's early models, named after Mercedes Jellinek, the daughter of Emil Jellinek, a prominent automobile dealer.</p>
        
        <p>Throughout the 20th century, Mercedes-Benz became synonymous with innovation and luxury. The introduction of the Mercedes-Benz 300SL in 1952, with its iconic gullwing doors, set new standards for sports cars.</p>
        
        <p>In the 1970s, Mercedes-Benz introduced the S-Class, which became a benchmark for luxury sedans. The brand continued to innovate with advancements in safety, performance, and technology, including the introduction of anti-lock braking systems (ABS) and airbags.</p>
        
        <p>Today, Mercedes-Benz is recognized worldwide for its commitment to quality, performance, and luxury, producing a wide range of vehicles from compact cars to high-performance sports cars and SUVs.</p>
